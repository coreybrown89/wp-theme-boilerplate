# Getting started

## Install
After installing WordPress, using terminal, navigate to your themes directory. 

Clone this git repo by using the following command:

```git clone https://github.com/coreybrown89/wp-theme-boilerplate.git```

This will download the latest version of wp-theme-boilerplate. 

*You can also download this repo by clicking on the link above. Unzip this folder and add it to your themes directory in WordPress.* 

## Setup

***functions.php***

Once you've successfully cloned the repo, head over to `functions.php`. Once there, you will want to find and replace all instances of `custom_theme`.

***style.css***

Head over to `style.css` in the root of the theme. In the comment at the top, reaname the `Theme Name`, `Author` and `Author URI` with your information. 

***screenshot.png***

To add a custom screenshot to your theme, replace the file screenshot.png with an image of your own. You must keep the filename the same for WordPress to recognize the image. Also, keep the image size `880x660` pixels.

Have fun!
